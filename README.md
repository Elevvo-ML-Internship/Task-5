# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System (User-Based CF & SVD)

## 📌 Overview

This project implements and evaluates two different **collaborative filtering approaches** for movie recommendations on the **MovieLens 100k dataset**:
1. **User-Based Collaborative Filtering (CF)** – recommends movies by finding similar users using cosine similarity.
2. **Matrix Factorization with SVD (Surprise Library)** – leverages latent factors to make predictions and generate recommendations.

The system evaluates models using **Precision@5**, measuring how many of the top-5 recommended movies were actually relevant to the user.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **Pandas & NumPy** – data processing
- **Scikit-Learn** – similarity calculation & splitting
- **Surprise (scikit-surprise)** – SVD matrix factorization
- **Cosine Similarity** – user-based recommendation

---

## 📂 Dataset

The project uses the [MovieLens 100k dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/100k/):

- **u.data** → User ratings (`user_id`, `item_id`, `rating`, `timestamp`)
- **u.item** → Movie metadata (`item_id`, `title`)

---

## ⚙️ Workflow

### 1. **User-Based Collaborative Filtering**

- Train-test split performed **per user** (ensures each user has both train & test ratings).
- User-Item matrix constructed.
- User-user similarity computed via **cosine similarity**.
- Recommendations generated by weighting ratings from **top-K similar users**.
- Evaluation with **Precision@5**.

### 2. **Matrix Factorization (SVD - Surprise)**

- Data converted to Surprise format.
- SVD model trained on trainset and evaluated on testset.
- Top-N recommendations extracted per user.
- Precision@5 computed.

## 📊 Results

|Model|Evaluated Users|Average Precision@5|
|---|---|---|
|**User-Based Collaborative Filtering**|943|**0.0579**|
|**SVD (Matrix Factorization)**|940|**0.9626**|

✅ **SVD vastly outperforms** user-based CF, showing the power of latent factor models in recommendation systems.
